# **Sign Up Form with Progress Bar**

* A **Progress Bar Form** is a long-form that has broken into multiple pieces. This type of form asked you to enter your details step by step before submitting your form. Some Multi-Step Form has Step Progress Bar on the top of Form or on some website itâ€™s placed on the bottom. Generally, This progress bar indicates or informs a user how many steps they have completed and how many steps are remaining.

* This form is long-form and it has broken into three steps. In each step, there are questions which user needs to enter. And Iâ€™ve also added a step progress bar on the top of the Form which indicates steps. There are **two buttons (Next and Previous)** on each step and in the last their is **submit button** also which displays a message when click on submit. When you click on the next button itâ€™ll redirect you to the next step and when you click on the previous button itâ€™ll redirect you to the previous step.

* **I hope you like this Progress Bar Sign Up Form by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.** ðŸ’™
